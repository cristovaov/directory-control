Plugin Name:  Directory Control
Description:  Specify the location of the uploads and themes directories
Version:      1.1.1
Author:       John Blackbourn
Author URI:   https://johnblackbourn.com/
Network:      true

## Usage ##

Define the `WP_UPLOAD_DIR`, `WP_UPLOAD_URL`, and `WP_THEME_DIR` constants
in your `wp-config.php` file to override the upload directory, upload URL
and theme directory respectively.

Example:

    define( 'WP_UPLOAD_DIR', 'stuff' );
    define( 'WP_UPLOAD_URL', 'http://example.com/stuff' );
    define( 'WP_THEME_DIR',  'skin' );

## Background ##

WordPress does not have a `WP_UPLOAD_DIR` constant. The `UPLOADS` constant
does not perform as expected and is always prepended with `ABSPATH`,
meaning it is impossible to use a root directory for uploads if WordPress
is installed in its own directory. This plugin fixes that by introducing
`WP_UPLOAD_DIR` and `WP_UPLOAD_URL` constants. Define these constants in
your `wp-config.php` file and their value will override the default upload
directory.

WordPress does not have a `WP_THEME_DIR` constant. Themes can only be
present in `WP_CONTENT_DIR/themes`. This plugin fixes that by introducing
`WP_THEME_DIR` and `WP_THEME_URL` constants. Define these constants in
your `wp-config.php` file and their value will override the default theme
directory.
